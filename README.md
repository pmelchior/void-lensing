void-lensing
============

This repository contains data and python code for the stacked weak-lensing measurement of cosmic voids in SDSS, as presented in the paper 
*First measurement of gravitational lensing by cosmic voids in SDSS* by Peter Melchior, P.M. Sutter, Erin S. Sheldon, Elisabeth Krause and Benjamin D. Wandelt:

The file [voids_rebinned.py](voids_rebinned.py) provides a reasonably detailed example of the code capabilities, most importantly the calculation of the E/B-mode lensing profile around voids in predefined bins of r/R_v, including errors from bootstrap resampling.
